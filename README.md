# Tic Tac Toe

My first project is a browser-based `Tic Tac Toe` game for a single player. The game is designed as a SPA.

## List of technologies used

1. Javascript
2. NPM
3. Grunt
4. JQuery library
5. JSON with Ajax
6. HTML, DOM
7. CSS, Bootstrap framework
8. cURL

## Planning and problem-solving strategy

### Planning
In order to organize my work on the project properly I created a plan which I followed along:
* Complete game project study
* Write user stories
* Draw wireframes
* Create a Github Repository for the project
* Write a game logic
* Work on the game UI
* Create user authentication forms
* Write the requests to game API
* Do the debugging process
* Produce project documentation
* Style

### Problem-solving strategy
* While working on the project I was breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts.
* Version control helped me to back up and track my project files. I created branches for each feature I worked on, made commits and merged working blocks of code into my master branch.
* With Grunt I ran and tested each block of my code in a browser.
* I organized my code into different modules. It made the code easier to read, test and refactor.

## Wireframes and user stories

### User stories
1. As a user I want to be able to register an account with email address and password.
2. As a user I want to be able to sign in by entering my email and password.
3. As a user I want to change current password when I'm signed in.
4. As a user I want to be able to log out when I'm signed in.
5. As a user I want to see a feedback after every action I make (action's success or failure).
6. As a user I want to start a new game by clicking on the `Start game` button.
7. As a user I want to play one game at a time.
8. As a user I want to play on a 3x3 grid.
9. As a user I want to be able to click on a grid square and see the result (`X` or `O`).
10. As a user I want to switch turns between `X` and `O` players.
11. As a user I want to see the result of each game (win or draw).
12. As a user I want to view game statistics.
13. As a user I want to see user statistics (ex. total games played, total games won).

## Unsolved problems
1. Improve the game UI by adding animation effects.
2. Provide more detailed user statistics.
3. Build a responsive UI for devices with different screen sizes.
4. Add more styling to the game (improve the color scheme).
5. Create a version of the game where user plays with AI.
